Spawn a PTY session inside the project dev environment.

This will automatically provision a Docker container if it does not exist yet.
Commands run inside the Docker container with the project directory mounted.
Use `shell` to keep the session alive after command exits. When proxy is enabled,
this registers `<project>.localhost` and routes it to the detected port (default 3000).

Examples:
- Start dev server: command="npm", args=["run", "dev"], title="Dev Server"
- Open shell: command="bash", title="Shell"
- Run with specific port: command="bun", args=["run", "dev", "--", "--port", "8000"]
