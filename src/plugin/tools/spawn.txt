Spawn a PTY session inside the project dev environment.

This will automatically provision a Docker container if it does not exist yet.
Commands run inside the Docker container with the project directory mounted.
Use `shell` to keep the session alive after command exits. When proxy is enabled,
this registers `<project>.localhost` and routes it to the detected port (default 3000).

Output includes:
- URL: The proxy URL (e.g., http://inbound.localhost) - use this in browser
- Direct URL: Container IP + port (e.g., http://192.168.x.x:3000) - for curl/verification
- Port: The detected or configured port number
- A curl command to verify the server is responding

Examples:
- Start dev server: command="npm", args=["run", "dev"], title="Dev Server"
- Open shell: command="bash", title="Shell"
- Run with specific port: command="bun", args=["run", "dev", "--", "--port", "8000"]
